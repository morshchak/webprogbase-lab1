  <p>
    Your note board is a platform for planning and competent organization of work.
    You can leave cards with notes on the board.
    You also have the opportunity to mark completed items, those that are in the process of development and those that have not yet been done.
    This site will be useful both for teams planning the workflow, and for ordinary users who want to plan their affairs.
  </p>
  <p>Sincerely, Karina Morshchak (Student of KPI and creator of Your Notes' Board)</p>
